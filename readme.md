Requirements
A full TeX distribution is assumed. Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, *nix) are available but TeX Live is recommended. You can install TeX from upstream (recommended; most up-to-date) or use sudo apt-get install texlive-full if you really want that. (It's generally a few years behind.)

If you don't want to install the dependencies on your system, this can also be obtained via Docker.

Usage
At a command prompt, run

xelatex {your-cv}.tex
